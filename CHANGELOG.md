## [1.0.0] - 2024-01-XX

### Added
- **HTTP-only remote validation** with configurable endpoints
- **Field-specific configuration** for different validation services
- **Runtime configuration updates** without page reload
- **Dependency injection** using InversifyJS for modular architecture
- **TypeScript support** with strong typing throughout
- **Built-in validators**: required, email, min/max length, pattern, match, remote
- **Message broker pattern** for decoupled component communication
- **Debug mode** for troubleshooting validation issues
- **Retry logic** for failed HTTP requests
- **Debouncing** to prevent API spam
- **Comprehensive documentation** with examples and architecture guides

### Architecture
- **FormEventBinder**: Listens to form events and dispatches validation requests
- **ValidatorDispatcher**: Routes validation requests to appropriate validators
- **RemoteValidator**: Handles HTTP-based remote validation
- **ConfigurationService**: Manages global and per-field configuration
- **HttpTransport**: Sends HTTP requests for remote validation
- **UIBinder**: Updates UI with validation results

### Configuration
- **Global HTTP settings**: baseUrl, timeout, headers, retry attempts
- **Field-specific overrides**: Different endpoints per field
- **Validation behavior**: validateOnBlur, validateOnChange, debounceDelay
- **UI configuration**: Error/success classes, validation icons

### Examples
- **http-only-demo.html**: Complete working example with configuration
- **Documentation**: Architecture overview, configuration guide, contributing guidelines

### Breaking Changes
- **HTTP-only approach**: Removed WebSocket support for simplicity and reliability
- **Simplified configuration**: Streamlined to focus on HTTP transport only

### Migration
- Previous WebSocket-based configurations need to be updated to HTTP endpoints
- Mixed transport demos removed in favor of HTTP-only approach

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- **Custom validator examples** for common use cases
- **Middleware examples** for logging and analytics
- **Performance optimizations** for large forms
- **Additional validators** based on community feedback
- **Framework integrations** (React, Vue, Angular examples)
